# Transcription sidecars

Each backend (CUDA / Vulkan / Metal / CPU) lives in its own Cargo crate that
compiles to a separate binary `flov-whisper-<backend>(.exe)`. The main app
(`flov.exe`) does not link `whisper-rs` itself — it spawns whichever sidecar
the user picked and pipes audio through stdin.

## Why separate workspaces

Each `crates/flov-whisper-*/Cargo.toml` declares an empty `[workspace]` so it
is **not** a member of the parent workspace. This is deliberate: Cargo would
otherwise unify `whisper-rs` features across crates and pull `cuda` into the
CPU sidecar (turning the "CPU build" into a CUDA build with extra DLL
dependencies). The parent workspace also has `exclude = ["crates/*"]` to make
the boundary explicit.

## Wire protocol

The same protocol is used by every sidecar. Source of truth:
`crates/flov-whisper-cpu/src/main.rs`.

```
args:   --model <path> --language <code>
stdin:  raw f32 LE PCM, 16 kHz mono. Parent closes stdin to signal end.
stdout: transcribed text (trimmed, no trailing newline).
stderr: human-readable progress / errors. Never on stdout.
exit:   0 on success, 1 on failure.
```

If you add a new backend, copy the existing CPU sidecar verbatim and flip the
`whisper-rs` feature flag in `Cargo.toml`. There is no other code change.

## Backend selection at runtime

`flov_app` resolves which sidecar to spawn for each transcription:

1. `FLOV_BACKEND=<name>` env var, if set, wins (debug knob).
2. `[backend].choice` in `flov.toml` (set by tray menu "Backend" radio).
3. Default `auto` walks `BACKEND_PRIORITY = [cuda, vulkan, metal, cpu]` and
   uses the first sidecar present next to `flov.exe`.

Missing sidecars are greyed-out in the tray menu, so the user can't pick one
that won't run.

## Building

`scripts/build-sidecars.ps1` builds every `crates/flov-whisper-*` it finds
and stages the binary (plus required runtime DLLs) into both
`target/debug/` and `target/release/`. It accepts `-Backend cuda` to limit
to one.

The CUDA build needs a working CUDA toolchain (env vars are pre-set in
`.cargo/config.toml`). The Vulkan build needs `VULKAN_SDK` to point at a
LunarG SDK install.

## Adding the Metal sidecar (macOS, Apple Silicon)

`crates/flov-whisper-metal/` doesn't exist yet — these are the steps to
create and ship it on a Mac with Xcode installed.

### 1. Create the crate

```bash
mkdir -p crates/flov-whisper-metal/src
```

`crates/flov-whisper-metal/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "flov-whisper-metal"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "Metal Whisper transcription sidecar for flov (Apple Silicon)"

[workspace]

[[bin]]
name = "flov-whisper-metal"
path = "src/main.rs"

[dependencies]
# `metal` enables the Metal backend in whisper.cpp.
# Add "coreml" too if you want ANE (Apple Neural Engine) acceleration
# — but that requires extra .mlmodelc files alongside the .bin model.
whisper-rs = { version = "0.16", features = ["metal"] }
anyhow = "1"
num_cpus = "1"

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
strip = true
```

`crates/flov-whisper-metal/src/main.rs`: copy `crates/flov-whisper-cpu/src/main.rs`
verbatim and rename strings/error prefixes from `cpu` to `metal`.

### 2. Build

No env vars needed — Metal headers ship with macOS. From repo root:

```bash
cargo build --release \
  --manifest-path crates/flov-whisper-metal/Cargo.toml \
  --target-dir target
```

### 3. Stage

```bash
cp target/release/flov-whisper-metal target/release/flov-whisper-metal
# also into target/debug/ if you run `tauri dev` on Mac
```

For packaged builds the binary needs to land next to `flov` inside the
`.app` bundle. Tauri's `externalBin` in `tauri.conf.json` is the supported
path — add an entry once we wire bundler config.

### 4. Verify

Start `flov`, check `flov.log`:

```
INFO flov_lib: available backends: ["metal", "cpu"]; configured choice: auto
INFO flov_lib::transcribe: transcribe via metal (...)
```

Metal will be picked automatically because it is ahead of `cpu` in
`BACKEND_PRIORITY`. Tray menu's "Metal (Apple Silicon)" item should be
enabled.

### Optional: CoreML for ANE acceleration

Add `coreml` to features. CoreML expects `<model>.mlmodelc` next to the
`.bin` (e.g. `ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin` + `ggml-large-v3-turbo-encoder.mlmodelc/`).
The whisper.cpp repo has scripts to generate these from a Whisper model.
First inference with CoreML compiles the model (slow, one-off), then ANE
takes over.
